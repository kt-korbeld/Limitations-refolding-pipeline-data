# Limitations of the refolding pipeline for de novo protein design

All non-schematic figures used in the paper are generated with the code in `Plots.ipynb` and saved in `./figures`. Figures used in the SI are saved in `./figures/figures_SI`. The underlying functions are imported from `plotting_analysis.py`. All processed data used to generate the figures is saved in `./data`, and input files and scripts neccesary to rerun the data are saved in `./generate_data`. For each figure, a short explanation is given what input files, scripts, data, and functions where used to generate the final figures is listed in `Plots.ipynb`.
